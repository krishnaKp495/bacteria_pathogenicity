Bacteria Harm Prediction
This project uses machine learning models to predict whether a given bacterium is harmful or not based on various characteristics from a dataset. The dataset used for training and testing was derived from this Kaggle dataset.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify bacteria as harmful or non-harmful based on specific biological features. Using a machine learning approach, we train a model that can accurately make this prediction, which can be useful in various microbiological and health-related research.

Key Features
Binary classification: Predicts whether a bacterium is harmful (1) or non-harmful (0).
Diverse features: The dataset includes multiple bacterial characteristics to build predictive features.
Dataset sourced from Kaggle: Utilizes a publicly available dataset for reproducibility and transparency.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project was sourced from Kaggle and can be found here(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kanchana1990/bacteria-dataset). It contains information on various bacterial traits, which are used to predict their harmfulness.
